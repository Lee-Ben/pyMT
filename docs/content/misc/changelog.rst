Change Log
==========
* 23/12/19
  * Added option to set equal or auto aspect ratio in the :ref:`Map Window` of :ref:`Data Plot`
  * Also added freezing of axis limits, so you can zoom / pan and keep the same view after changing what is plotted.
* 14/12/19
  * Fixed induction arrow plotting in data_plot so that un-normalized arrows are actually useable. Not thoroughly tested however.
  * Added option to specify a 'cutoff' length for induction arrows. Arrows with magnitudes greater than this will not be plotted.
  * Added secondary phase tensor plotting as inner bars within the phase tensor ellipses (as in Hering et al., 2019)
  * Fixed bath2model script to properly specify ocean and air cells within the covariance file.
  * In the process of fixing and testing how covariance files need to be written.
* 28/11/19
  * Fixed a bug where ModEM data files would include elevations if data was read directly from EDI files (which would put the receivers underground)
  * Added a static value to the Data class 'Data.REMOVE_FLAG', which is meant to be assigned to data points you want removed from the inversion data file
    * Currently not functional with the GUIs, but can be used to assign recognizable error values to data points to be removed, which can then be removed manually
    * Will (eventually) add these things into the GUIs...
  * Added an option to write model to CSV file (accessible via the API only right now)
  * Added functionality to read / write 2-D ModEM models and data
    * Still buggy and less than ideal. Is you're data really that 2-D anyways?
* 10/11/19
  * ModEM data file read function now checks for sign convention and units
    * Will automatically convert to exp(-iÏ‰t) and ohms
* 01/10/19
  * Added a script to add oceans and topography
    * Still experimental - model seems to be built correctly, but covariance file needs corrections
  * To fit above, changed default behavior of data file writing:
    * By default, elevations will not be used (i.e., Z = 0 for all stations). Add 'use_elevation=True' as a named parameter in your write to include elevations
    * Note that due to a bug, previous versions may have included elevations in the written ModEM data files which could lead to spurious results.
* 09/09/19
  * Need to add these to the docs changelog when I get that fixed
  * Added turbo and turbo_r to colour maps
      * Should automaticaly be working in Model Viewer, not yet in Data Plot
  * Changed the way ModEM data files are read in to allow for arbitrary ordering of the data lines
      * This seems to be working without complaint, but may have some unintended side effects!
* 08/08/19
	* Some changes to IO to start to allow different periods for different sites (not fully implemented yet)
	* Some bug fixes related to reading data files
* 30/07/19
	* :ref:`Model` class can now read and write model covariance files
	* :ref:`Mesh Designer` will automatically prompt for covariance file output when writing a model.
	* Added documentation for some of the more usuable scripts.
* 23/07/19
	* Re-release of pyMT onto GitHub
	* Now with (some) documentation!
