Launching the Data Plotter
==========================

The data plotting GUI is launched from the command line. A number of options exist on exactly how to specify which files you would like to use, which can be accessed using::
	
	data_plot -h

which will output::

	Options include:
         -d : Use default startup file "pystart"
         -b : Browse for start file or data files (Not yet implemented)
         -n : Specify the start file you wish to use
         -l : List the dataset names present in the start file you have chosen
         -c : Choose a specific dataset(s) listed within the start file you have chosen
                 For multiple datasets, separate names with a colon (:)

The most common method of launching the GUI is::
	
	data_plot -n <startup_file> -c <dataset_name>

which requires that you have created a `Startup file`_

Required Files
--------------

The data plotting GUI requires at minimum a `startup file`_ containing at least one of the following:

* `List File`_
* `Data File`_
* `Response File`_

Startup File
************

The startup file specifies the relevant paths and files, as well as the roles of those files. 
The startup file is broken into seperate data sets, with a '%' denoting the beginning of a new data set specification. A data set can contain one `list file`_, `data file`_, and `response file`_, or any permutation thereof (as long as only one of each is specified per data set). Additionally, you can specify a common path to each file, as well as a separate path which points to the location of the raw data files (EDI or j-format files), although this has not been fully tested, and so specifying relative or absolute paths is the safer option for now.
An example startup file is as follows::

	% data_set1
	list allsites.lst
	data inv.dat
	% data_set2
	list EDIs/broadband.lst
	% data_set3
	list EDIs/broadband.lst
	data inversion2/broadband.dat
	resp inversion2/inv_response.dat

Assuming this file is called 'pystart' and the terminal is in the same folder, the GUI can be launched with (for example)::

	data_plot -n pystart -c data_set1:data_set2

Data File
*********

The data files are those that are used as input to your inversions.
Currently implemented formats are:

* ModEM (2-D)
* ModEM (3-D)
* WSINV3DMT
* Occam2D
* MARE2DEM

Thus far, only ModEM and WSINV3DMT file formats have been used extensively. Other formats, while implemented, have not been thoroughly tested.

Response File
*************

The response file output from an inversion. If the format of data and response files is the same for your given inversion code (as is the case for ModEM), then data and response files may be used interchangeably.

Currently implemented formats are the same as for the `data files`_

List File
*********

A list file specifies the EDI or j-format files you would like to
