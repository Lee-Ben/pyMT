<p>All dependencies will be installed during this process, however if you are coming from a clean python installation, it may be best to manually install certain packages with potentially complicated dependencies.
These include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>pip</p></li>
<li><p>numpy</p></li>
<li><p>scipy</p></li>
<li><p>matplotlib</p></li>
<li><p>pyqt</p></li>

<span id="id1"></span><h3>Startup File<a class="headerlink" href="#startup-file" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The startup file specifies the relevant paths and files, as well as the roles of those files.
The startup file is broken into seperate data sets, with a ‘%’ denoting the beginning of a new data set specification, and the subsequent lines giving the role and paths of the files to be used. Lines starting with a ‘#’ will be ignored, which allows the insertion of comments.
A data set can contain one <a class="reference internal" href="#list-file">List File</a>, <a class="reference internal" href="#data-file">Data File</a>, and <a class="reference internal" href="#response-file">Response File</a>, or any permutation thereof (as long as only one of each is specified per data set). Additionally, you can specify a common path to each file, as well as a separate path which points to the location of the raw data files (EDI or j-format files), although this has not been fully tested, and so specifying relative or absolute paths is the safer option for now.
An example startup file is as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># This specification assumes allsites.lst, inv.dat, and the EDI/j-format files are all in the same folder as pystart</span>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Options can (and generally should) be used in conjuction.
For example, the most common method of launching the GUI is:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">data_plot</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">startup_file</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">c</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">dataset_name</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This will open the <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#startup-file"><span class="std std-ref">Startup File</span></a> and initialize the GUI with the specified dataset. If no dataset is give (i.e., the -c flag is not used), all datasets within &lt;startup_file&gt; will be loaded.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="required-files">
<h4>Required Files<a class="headerlink" href="#required-files" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The data plotting GUI requires at minimum a <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#startup-file"><span class="std std-ref">Startup File</span></a> containing at least one of the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="index.html#list-file"><span class="std std-ref">List File</span></a></p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="index.html#data-file"><span class="std std-ref">Data File</span></a></p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="index.html#response-file"><span class="std std-ref">Response File</span></a></p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="default-behavior">
<h4>Default Behavior<a class="headerlink" href="#default-behavior" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>A few things to note about the default behavior of data_plot:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Raw data (data read in from EDI / j-format files indicated in a list file) are shown by filled circles</p></li>
<li><p>Inversion data (data read in or created for use in inversion) are indicated by filled circles with a black outline</p></li>
<li><p>Response data (data read in from an inversion response file) is indicated by a solid line</p></li>
<li><p>By default, data is displayed as is. Particularly for impedance data, it is useful to view it multiplied the periods or square root of the periods to be able to visualize both short and long periods equally well. This can be done through the <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#scaling"><span class="std std-ref">Scaling</span></a> drop-down menu.</p></li>
<li><p>Some of the features of the Data Plot GUI and the <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#map-viewer"><span class="std std-ref">Data Plot - Map Viewer</span></a> require raw data in order to operate (e.g., addition of periods). Therefore it is generally best to include a <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#list-file"><span class="std std-ref">List File</span></a> in all datasets to be plotted.</p></li>
<li><p>The <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#map-viewer"><span class="std std-ref">Data Plot - Map Viewer</span></a> plot is updated any time a contained element is changed. In general this operation is fast. However, if a pseudosection is being plotted in the <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#map-window"><span class="std std-ref">Map Window</span></a>, any operation involving a new plot (including changing the viewed sites using the <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#forward-and-back-buttons"><span class="std std-ref">Forward and Back Buttons</span></a>) may become quite slow.</p></li>
<li><dl class="simple">
<dt>When only a <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#list-file"><span class="std std-ref">List File</span></a> is specified for the loaded dataset, a <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#data"><span class="std std-ref">Data</span></a> object will be initialized by taking logarithmically spaced periods.</dt><dd><ul>
<li><p>In this instance, the <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#map-viewer"><span class="std std-ref">Data Plot - Map Viewer</span></a> is not initialized properly, and no site locations are shown. The workaround is to re-sort the station locations (e.g., sort by west-east then re-sort back to default) and click the forward or back button. These operations should get the stations plotting.</p></li>

<h4>Tabs Window<a class="headerlink" href="#tabs-window" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<div class="figure align-center">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/data_plot_tabs_window.png"><img alt="_images/data_plot_tabs_window.png" src="_images/data_plot_tabs_window.png" style="width: 960.0px; height: 516.0px;" /></a>
</div>
<p>The Tabs Window is the main control window for the Data Plot GUI. There are (currently) 5 tabs, with each giving different options for either the manipulation or plotting of the data.</p>
<div class="section" id="data-selection">
<h5>Data Selection<a class="headerlink" href="#data-selection" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<div class="figure align-center">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/data_plot_selection_tab.png"><img alt="_images/data_plot_selection_tab.png" src="_images/data_plot_selection_tab.png" style="width: 667.0px; height: 131.0px;" /></a>
</div>
<p>The main controls within the Data Selection tab are the ‘Add Periods to Data’ checkbox, and the ‘Site List’ / ‘Removed Sites’ tables.</p>
<div class="section" id="adding-and-removing-periods">
<h6>Adding and Removing Periods<a class="headerlink" href="#adding-and-removing-periods" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h6>
<p>By default, clicking on the plots within the <a class="reference internal" href="#plot-window">Plot Window</a> gives behavior similar to what you would expect from a normal plot window (e.g., you can use the <a class="reference internal" href="#toolbar">Toolbar</a> options to pan, zoom, etc.)
To add and remove periods from the inversion, you must first override these controls by checking the ‘Add Periods to Data’ checkbox.</p>
<p>Once checked, you can add periods to the inversion by left clicking on a data point that is not already included in the inversion (i.e., a filled, non-outlined circle within a plot). Doing so will add the selected period to the stored data across all sites, and should result in the data point becoming highlighted across all plots.</p>
<p>Periods can be removed from the inversion data by right clicking on an active data point (i.e., one that is outlined in black). This will remove the selected point from the inversion data, resulting in the points outline being removed from all plots.</p>
<p>When you are done selecting periods, uncheck the ‘Add Periods to Data’ checkbox to resume normal plot behavior.</p>
<p>Note that if a period is selected that is not available at all stations, the data from the closest available period will be used instead at those stations. Be careful when adding periods that are not available at all stations. In extreme cases (e.g., when mixing AMT and broadband data), the closest available period at some sites may be too far from the selected period to be reliably substituted, and essentially becomes dummy data. The error bars on any dummy data must be increased (either within the Data Plot GUI, or programatically), or the data point itself must be manually edited (either programatically or within a data file).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sorting-sites">
<h6>Sorting Sites<a class="headerlink" href="#sorting-sites" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h6>
<p>By default, the order of the stations is the same as the order in which they were read in (i.e., the order in which they appear within a <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#list-file"><span class="std std-ref">List File</span></a> or <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#data-file"><span class="std std-ref">Data File</span></a>).</p>
<p>The ‘Sort Sites’ drop down menu can be used to reorder the stations by location. Available options are west-to-east, south-to-north, and ‘Clustering’. The ‘Clustering’ option attempts to sort the stations by proximity to each other, so nearby sites are listed next to each other.</p>
<p>At any time you can restore the original ordering by selecting ‘Default’.</p>
<p>Reording the stations results in the order being changed within the ‘Site List’ table, which gives the order in which the stations will be displayed when iterating using the <a class="reference internal" href="#forward-and-back-buttons">Forward and Back Buttons</a></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="current-dataset">
<h6>Current Dataset<a class="headerlink" href="#current-dataset" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h6>
<p>The Current Dataset drop-down menu controls which dataset is being displayed. If only one dataset was read in from the used <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#startup-file"><span class="std std-ref">Startup File</span></a>, then only one option will be available.</p>
<p>Note: This feature has not been extensively tested, and at this point is mainly for comparing different inversion results within the same Data Plot window. A known bug exists where changing between different datasets does not update the <a class="reference internal" href="#misfit-table">Misfit Table</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="print-periods">
<h6>Print Periods<a class="headerlink" href="#print-periods" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h6>
<p>This button will print diagnostic information about the periods contained in the dataset into the Debug Window (the far right window within the Data Selection tab).</p>
<p>The printed periods correspond to those periods that are available at least 50% of the stations.
The first column gives the period values. Negative values indicate frequencies instead (1 / period).
The second column gives log10(period).</p>
<p>The last column gives the fraction of stations at which the period is available.
Stars indicate that the periods in that row are currently included in the inversion data.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="azimuth">
<h6>Azimuth<a class="headerlink" href="#azimuth" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h6>
<p>The azimuth spinbox controls the rotation of the stations (both locations and data coordinate system).
The azimuth is always set to a positive number between 0-359.</p>
<p>Data and station rotations are currently set up for 3-D inversion, in that a positive azimuth results in a clockwise rotation (from north) of the station locations, and a counter-clockwise rotation of the data. As a result, the rotating the data within the Data Plot GUI is not suitable to rotation and projection into 2-D.</p>
<p>This feature has been tested, but not used extensively. Therefore, always double check that the location and data rotations are correct. Inverting incorrectly rotated data leads to incorrect models.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="site-list">
<h6>Site List<a class="headerlink" href="#site-list" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h6>
<p>The ‘Site List’ and ‘Remove Sites’ indicate which sites are currently included in the inversion data, and which have been removed, respectively.</p>
<p>Sites can be removed by selecting them within the Site List and clicking the right arrow (to the right of the list). Sites that have been removed can be added back in by selecting them within the Removed Sites table and clicking the left arrow.</p>
<p>Currently there is no way to add new sites to an existing <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#data-file"><span class="std std-ref">Data File</span></a> from within the Data Plot GUI. Such an operation can be done programatically through the API. See the <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#recipes"><span class="std std-ref">Recipes</span></a> section for more details.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="diagnostic-windows">
<h6>Diagnostic Windows<a class="headerlink" href="#diagnostic-windows" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h6>
<p>There are 2 additional widgets within the Data Selection tab that are non-interactive and only for display purposes.</p>
<p>The first is the ‘# Params’ box, which simply displays the number of periods and number of sites currently included in the inversion data.</p>
<p>The second is an empty white box that displays diagnostic information. Since the terminal used to launch the Data Plot GUI is inaccessible during operation of the GUI, information will be printed here instead (e.g., information printed out from the <a class="reference internal" href="#print-periods">Print Periods</a> button)</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="plot-options">

</div>
<p>The Plot Options tab controls what is plotted within the <a class="reference internal" href="#plot-window">Plot Window</a>. Additionaly, the <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#map-viewer"><span class="std std-ref">Data Plot - Map Viewer</span></a> is accessed from within this tab.</p>
<div class="section" id="toggle-plots">
<h6>Toggle Plots<a class="headerlink" href="#toggle-plots" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h6>
<p>The Toggle Plots groupbox contains checkboxes for toggling elements to be plotted, as well as some aspects of the plots themselves.</p>
<p>The Raw Data, Data, and Response checkboxes toggle on and off the plotting of their respective components. If a particular data type is not available, the corresponding button <em>should</em> be inactive.</p>
<p>The Show Outliers checkbox adds or removes outliers from the <a class="reference internal" href="#plot-window">Plot Window</a>. This does not remove them from the inversion data or the raw data, but rather trims the axis limits to not include such data within the plots.</p>
<p>It is worth mentioning that the algorithm used to detect outliers is very basic and not particularly robust.</p>
<p>The Lock Axes checkbox is used to force all plots to have the same axis limits. Useful when flipping through the stations to check, e.g., data quality.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="error-bars">
<h6>Error Bars<a class="headerlink" href="#error-bars" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h6>
<p>The Error Bars groupbox controls which error bars are plotted.</p>
<p>When ‘Data Errors’ is selected, the errors from the original data file are used.</p>
<p>When ‘Used Errors’ is selected, the errors that will be used in the inversion are shown, i.e., the original data errors multiplied by the error map.</p>
<p>The No Errors button removes all error bars from the plots.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="scaling">
<span id="id4"></span><h6>Scaling<a class="headerlink" href="#scaling" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h6>
<p>The Scaling drop-down menu controls how the plotted data is scaled when viewed.
‘None’ indicates that the unaltered data is shown.
‘Periods’ multiplies each data point by its period. Only useful when viewing short and long period data similtaneously.</p>
<p>‘Sqrt(Periods)’ multiples each data point by the square root of its period. This is the most common option when viewing impedance data, as it allows both short and long period data to be viewed equally well.</p>
<p>The chosen scale factor is only applied to impedance and tipper data, and not for derived data types such as the apparent resistivity and phase.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="subplots">
<span id="id5"></span><h6>Subplots<a class="headerlink" href="#subplots" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h6>
<p>The # Subplots edit line controls how many subplots are shown in the <a class="reference internal" href="#plot-window">Plot Window</a>. The default value is 6. Any positive value works here, however larger values will increase the time it takes to change the plots as the program will have to iterate through more stations to generate each new set of plots.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="show-map">
<span id="id6"></span><h6>Show Map<a class="headerlink" href="#show-map" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h6>
<p>The Show Map button is used to launch the <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#map-viewer"><span class="std std-ref">Data Plot - Map Viewer</span></a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="data-component-table">
<span id="id7"></span><h6>Data Component Table<a class="headerlink" href="#data-component-table" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h6>
<p>The final and largest widget in the Tabs Window is the Data Component Table. This controls which components are plotted into the <a class="reference internal" href="#plot-window">Plot Window</a>.</p>
<p>Any number of components can be plotted at the same time by using CTRL+click, SHFT+click, or click+drag provided they are contained in the same column of the table. If components from different columns are selected (e.g., an ZXXR and RhoXY), a pop-up window will appear with a warning and the selected components will be reset.</p>
<p>There is a known bug where the blank items of the table are selectable. However, this results in the first available component being plotted instead, and so should not break the GUI.</p>
</div>

<div class="section" id="misfit-table">
<span id="id8"></span><h5>Misfit Table<a class="headerlink" href="#misfit-table" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>

<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/data_plot_misfit_tab.png"><img alt="_images/data_plot_misfit_tab.png" src="_images/data_plot_misfit_tab.png" style="width: 952.0px; height: 131.0px;" /></a>
</div>
<p>The Misfit Table tab shows information regarding the misfits (calculated as the RMS differences) between the data and response. The tab is separated into two tables.</p>
<p>The left hand table shows the misfit on a per site basis, with each row representing a single site and each column representing a given data component.</p>
<p>The right hand table gives the misfits on a per period basis, again with each row representing a single period and each column representing a single data component.</p>
<p>Both tables have an additional column for the ‘total misfit’ across each row. For the left table, this means the total misfit per site (averaged across all components and periods), and in the right table it gives the total misfit per period (averaged across all sites and components).</p>
<p>The right hand table also contains an additional row at the top that gives the total misfit across all periods and sites for each column. As such, the top left entry of the right table gives the total misfit of the inversion.</p>
<p>Note, the RMS misfits in this table may differ slightly from what logged by ModEM as pyMT always applies an error floor to any data read in. As ModEM does not explicitly use (or store) an applied error floor, the hard-coded error floors of pyMT may differ from those used in the inversion. As a result, if you used a lower error floor than those coded into pyMT, the misfits shown in this table will be lower.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="error-multipliers">
<span id="id9"></span><h5>Error Multipliers<a class="headerlink" href="#error-multipliers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>

<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/data_plot_multipliers_tab.png"><img alt="_images/data_plot_multipliers_tab.png" src="_images/data_plot_multipliers_tab.png" style="width: 957.0px; height: 134.0px;" /></a>
</div>
<p>The Error Multipliers tab is the main control window for setting the data errors. In order to compatible with both WSINV3DMT and ModEM, the error control takes form of integer multiples.
The multipliers shown in a Tree Widget. Site names are given in the left-most column with a small arrow beside them. Clicking on the arrow will collapse or expand the error multiplier tree for that site.
Changing the errors is done by double clicking on the multiplier value for the desired site, period, and component and changing it to the desired value. Assuming you edit the multiplier for a site and component that is currently being plotted, the new errors should be displayed immediately after the edit is completed.</p>
<p>As manually editing many sites, periods, and components is <em>incredibly</em> tedious, a few keyboard shortcuts have been made available.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Holding SHFT while double clicking to edit a multiplier will result in all periods for the chosen site and component being changed.</p></li>
<li><p>Holding CTRL while double clicking will edit the multiplier for all components for the chosen site and period</p></li>
<li><p>Holding ALT while double clicking will edit the multiplier for all sites for the chosen component and period</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The keyboard shortcuts may be used in conjunction with one another as well. For instance, holding SHFT+CTRL while double clicking to edit will change the multipliers for all periods and all components across a single station.</p>
<p>Note, double clicking to edit a multiplier and then entering the same value will result in no changes being made, regardless of any keyboard shortcuts being used.</p>
<p>Default behavior of the Error Multiplier tree widget is to have the stations automatically expand and scroll to the sites currently displayed in the <a class="reference internal" href="#plot-window">Plot Window</a>.</p>
<p>The Error Multiplier tree currently only accepts integer values. However, negative values may be used to decrease the applied errors.
For example, setting a multiplier to 5 increases the error by, and subsequently setting the multiplier to -2 would divide the error by 2, resulting in a total error of 2.5 times the original error.</p>
<p>Entering a negative value does however result in the multiplier value being reset to 1, in order to ensure consistent use between ModEM and WSINV3DMT data formats.</p>

</div>
<p>The Error Manipulations tab allows for more broad-stroke error setting compared.
Within the Group Manipulations box are 3 buttons.
The ‘Refresh’ button is a debug button. All it does is force the <a class="reference internal" href="#error-multipliers">Error Multipliers</a> tree to reset. This button should not be needed, but does nothing to the data itself.</p>
<p>The ‘Regulate Errors’ button automatically sets errors for the entire dataset in the following manner.
A smoothed version of the raw data is calculated using a smoothing filter.</p>
<p>The filter length is given by the value in the ‘Filter Length’ spinbox. The higher the value, the more smoothing is applied (values between 0.7 and 1.2 have are generally good).</p>
<p>The distance between the data points and the smooth curve is then calculated, and multiplied by the value in the ‘Multiplier’ spinbox. This value is then set as the error.</p>
<p>The result of this process is that data that is already nearly smoothly varying have relatively low errors, while outliers jittery data will have higher error.</p>
<p>The ‘Reset Errors’ button simply resets all errors to the error floor. Floor values are given for each set of components in the table to the right of the ‘Group Manipulations’ groupbox.</p>

If both checkboxes are selected, the phase tensor misfit tensor is plotted, as defined in Heise et al. (2007):</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\mathbf{\Delta} = \mathbf{I} - \frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{\Phi}^{-1}\mathbf{\Phi} + \mathbf{\Phi}\mathbf{\Phi}^{-1})\]</div>
<p>In this case, the colour of the ellispes may also be filled by the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\delta\)</span> value give as a percentage, defined by:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\delta = 100 * \left| \mathbf{\Delta} / \mathbf{\Phi} \right|\]</div>
<p>All other phase tensor fill values are defined as in Cadwell et al., 2004. This includes the skew value <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\beta\)</span>, and so the recommended upper limit for approximate two-dimensionality is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\beta \leq \left|3^{\circ} \right|\)</span></p>

<div class="section" id="pseudosection">
<h5>Pseudosection<a class="headerlink" href="#pseudosection" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>The Pseudosection groupbox gives options for plotting map view sections of the apparent resistivity and phase. The sections are generated using the Natural Neighbor interpolation scheme of Sibson (1981), as implemented in the naturalneighbor python package (<a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/project/naturalneighbor/">https://pypi.org/project/naturalneighbor/</a>)</p>
<p>The first two radio buttons control whether the apparent resistivity or phase is plotted.</p>
<p>The Data and Response checkboxes plot the sections from the inversion data or response files, respectively, while checking both boxes will result in difference plots. The difference in apparent resistivities is expressed as a percent difference, while for phase it is given in degrees.</p>
<p>The XY, YX, and determinant resistivities and phases may be toggled through the drop-down menu.</p>
<p>The Interp points spinbox controls how many grid points are used in the section interpolation. The default is 200 points. Few points may be used to increase the responsiveness of the GUI, while more points may be used for a finer grid.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="plot-rms">
<h5>Plot RMS<a class="headerlink" href="#plot-rms" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>The relative RMS misfit of each station can be overlaid by checking the Plot RMS checkbox. Unlike the other data plotting options in this window, the RMS misfit overlay does not change per period, but reflects instead the total RMS misfit across all periods and components for each site.</p>

<p>The Map Window is the plot area of the Map Viewer. The site locations are plotted here, along with any data components that have been activated in the <a class="reference internal" href="#control-dock">Control Dock</a>.</p>
<p>By default, only the station locations are plotted along with the annotation style set in the <a class="reference internal" href="#point-options">Point Options</a> menu. A colour bar will be added if necessary, e.g., when plotting phase tensor ellipses.</p>
<p>Note that the subplot used is set to fill the available space, and therefore does not have an equal aspect ratio.</p>
<p>The toolbar at the bottom of the Map Window may be used to pan, zoom, and customize the plot itself.</p>
<p>The Map Window is reset any time an element of the plot changes. As such, zoom and pans that are applied will not be remembered when the plot is changed. This may be changed in a future release.</p>

<div class="section" id="default-behavior">
<h4>Default Behavior<a class="headerlink" href="#default-behavior" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Assuming valid files are used, the GUI should launch into the 2-D view, with the slice locations set to X=1, Y=1, Z=1 (bottom, left, and surface slices, respectively)</p>
<p>The 3-D view is initialized to a top-down (XY) view.</p>
<p>Default colour map is ‘jet_plus’, a modified version of the Matlab default ‘jet’ with lower and upper colour map limits of 1 and 5 (log10 scale).</p>
<p>Note that currently there is no colour bar shown for the 2-D views.</p>
<p>Currently the data file is used only to plot the station locations over the model. Plotting of induction arrows and phase tensors will likely be added in the future.</p>

<p>The Control Dock contains options for navigating through the model. Only the Mesh tab has been implemented in this release. The Control Dock can be detached from the main window to make more space for the <a class="reference internal" href="#plot-window">Plot Window</a>.</p>
<p>The Mesh tab has two groupboxes: Trim and Slices</p>
<p>The Trim groupbox is used to adjust the bounds of the model that are plotted.</p>
<p>By default, the full model is shown. Edit each line beside the South, North, etc., labels to define how many cells to trim from the corresponding directions. Hit the Trim Volume button to perform the operation. This operation will generate new model plots for all of the subplots in the <a class="reference internal" href="#id1">2D View</a>, as well as for the <a class="reference internal" href="#d-view">3D View</a>.</p>
<p>The Slices groupbox controls which slices are plotted. The X, Y, and Z checkboxes are used to turn off/on the corresponding slices in within the <a class="reference internal" href="#d-view">3D View</a>. The nearby line edits and slider bars are used to control the location of the each plotted slice.</p>
<p>The last line in the Slices groupbox is used to generate a transect slice along a specified set of points.</p>

<h4>Default Behavior<a class="headerlink" href="#default-behavior" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The default behavior is different depending on what files are input.
If only a model file is used, the GUI initialized using the given model, and no station locations are plotted. In this case, the ‘Regenerate Mesh’ button will not be functional.</p>
<p>If only a data file is used, an initial model will be created based on the bounds of the given stations. There is a known bug here where the inital view of the model cuts of the outer edges. Hitting the ‘Add Pads’ a few times will extend the model out a bit to cover the whole area covered by the stations.</p>
<p>If both model and data files are given, the mesh will be shown as it is in the given model, with the station locations overlaid.</p>
<p>As this GUI is not meant for viewing the model, the slice shown is always the first depth slice.</p>
<p>The GUI works equally well for creating new meshes as it does for modifying existing ones.</p>

<h5>Manipulate Mesh<a class="headerlink" href="#manipulate-mesh" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>The Manipulate Mesh tab is used to, as the name suggests, to modify and manipulate the mesh used.</p>
<p>Specifically, there are 3 things that can be modified from this tab: The XY Padding, the Z mesh (or depth mesh), and the background resistivity.</p>
<p>The XY Padding groupbox is used to add and remove padding cells in the XY plane.</p>
<p>The Add Pad and Remove Pad buttons add and remove pads from the left / right / top bottom/ of the XY plane, depending on which of the corresponding checkboxes are selected.</p>
<p>When adding pads, the size of the new pad is determined by taking the size of the outer most cell and multiplying it by the value in the Pad Size Multiplier spinbox.</p>

</ul>
<p>The depth mesh is controlled through the Z Mesh groupbox.  The thickness of the first slice (in meters) is specified in the First Depth edit line. The final depth (i.e., the maximum depth to use in the mode) is specified in the Last Depth edit line.</p>
<p>Specification of the mesh between the first and last depth is controlled in the Depths per decade list. This list will be automatically populated with a list of values. The length of this list is such that there is one value per decade of depth.</p>
<p>Once each of these values has been specified, hit the Generate Depths button to generate the Z mesh.</p>
<p>For example, for a first depth of 1 m and a last depth of 500000 m, the Depths per will be populated with 6 values. From top to bottom, they correspond to the number of layers used between depths of:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>1-10 m</p></li>
<li><p>10-100 m</p></li>
<li><p>100-1000 m</p></li>
<li><p>1000-10000 m</p></li>
<li><p>10000-100000 m</p></li>
<li><p>100000-500000 m</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In this instance, each value corresponds to the number of logarithmically spaced layers to use within each decade.</p>
<p>As a general rule of thumb, it is best to ensure that the sizes of the layers are always increasing. In accordance with this, the program will check the 2nd derivative of the generated mesh. If the derivative is negative anywhere, a message will appear saying so.</p>
<p>The backround resistivity of the model may be changed by editing the corresponding line and clicking the Set Background button.</p>

<p>Fine grained modification of the mesh is done within this window.</p>
<p>Left click anywhere within the mesh to add a new vertical mesh line. Right click to add a horizontal mesh line.</p>
<p>Holding CTRL while left or right clicking will remove the nearest vertical / horizontal mesh line, respectively.</p>
<p>Refrain from double clicking within this window. Although some precautions have been implemented to avoid generated invalid meshes, double clicking can sometimes result in multiple mesh lines in the same location, i.e., a cell with 0 width, which will subsequently crash ModEM.</p>

<h3>Adding Data to an Existing Data File<a class="headerlink" href="#adding-data-to-an-existing-data-file" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Adding new periods to an existing data file is supported through the <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#data-plot"><span class="std std-ref">Data Plot - Main Window</span></a> GUI. However, it is assumed that the list file and data file used are consistent, i.e., that they have the same stations and in the same order.
Therefore, adding new stations to an existing data file must be done using the pyMT API.</p>
<p>This example uses the <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#data"><span class="std std-ref">Data</span></a>, and <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#rawdata"><span class="std std-ref">RawData</span></a> classes as well as the Data.get_data and Data.add_site methods.</p>
<p>Assuming the data file we want to modify is ‘demo.dat’, and the list file we want to pull in new sites from is ‘raw/all.lst’:</p>

</pre></div>

<p>Alternatively, multiple ModEM data files can be combined (e.g., append tipper data from one file into another), so long as resulting file still adheres to pyMT’s requirements (i.e., uniform periods and data components for all sites).</p>

<div class="section" id="working-with-inconsistent-periods-components">
<h3>Working with Inconsistent Periods / Components<a class="headerlink" href="#working-with-inconsistent-periods-components" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Sometimes it may be desireable to invert a data set that has a non-uniform period set and / or component set, for example when mixing AMT and BB stations. If the number of wasted data points is low (maybe 3-4 frequencies total), it is usually simpler to just set high errors to the unavailable frequencies and let the inversion run as normal (the number of processors required is the same regardless, addition RAM required for wasted data points is low).
Note, a ‘wasted data point’ is a data point which is will be inverted at a subset of stations, but is unavailable at other stations (most often when mixing stations with different bandwidths, or stations with / without tipper)
However, if you intend to invert many frequencies and / or components that would be unavailable at a subset of stations, there is a workaround. This workaround requires some knowledge of Python, and preferably a text editor that allows you to find, select, and remove all lines containing a particular string (e.g., Sublime Text).</p>
<p>First, you should set up the ModEM data file as usual (i.e., using Data Plot or j2ws3d).
Make note of (or intentionally set up) any patterns you can use to distinguish your stations. In this example, broadband stations end in ‘M’, and AMT stations end in ‘A’. The final 4 periods of AMT stations, and first 3 periods of BB stations will be flagged and removed.:</p>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This will create a new data file with the periods to be removed flagged with errors corresponding to the Data.REMOVE_FLAG (at the time of writing, it is 1234567)</p>
<p>Open this file in your text editor of choice. Find all instances of the REMOVE_FLAG, cut and paste the corresponding lines so they are all at the end of the file (this isn’t required, it just makes life easier). Save this to ‘demo_flagged.dat’. Now remove the corresponding lines. Save this to a new data file (e.g., ‘demo_removed.dat’)
You can now invert the ‘demo_removed.dat’. When using pyMT, you will still have to use the ‘demo_flagged.dat’ version which has a uniform period band. Furthermore, when reading in the response file created by inverting ‘demo_removed.dat’, you will have to copy-paste the removed periods from ‘demo_flagged.dat’ into it (this is why I moved the flagged lines to the end of the file).</p>
<p>I apologize for this incredibly roundabout method. Allowing for non-uniform data files in pyMT will require a large re-working of the code, and at this time it is more important to have working tools with some odd quirks than to have fully featured tools with game-breaking bugs.</p>

<p>GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 29 June 2007</p>
<p>Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;<a class="reference external" href="http://fsf.org/">http://fsf.org/</a>&gt;
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>
<p>Preamble</p>
<p>The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.</p>
<p>The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program–to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.</p>
<p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.</p>
<p>To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.</p>
<p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.</p>
<p>Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.</p>
<p>For the developers’ and authors’ protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users’ and
authors’ sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.</p>
<p>Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users’ freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.</p>
<p>Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.</p>
<p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.</p>
<p>TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="0">
<li><p>Definitions.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.</p>
<p>“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.</p>
<p>“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as “you”.  “Licensees” and
“recipients” may be individuals or organizations.</p>
<p>To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the
earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.</p>
<p>A “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.</p>
<p>To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.</p>
<p>To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.</p>
<p>An interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices”
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Source Code.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  “Object code” means any non-source
form of a work.</p>
<p>A “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.</p>
<p>The “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
“Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.</p>
<p>The “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work’s
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.</p>
<p>The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.</p>
<p>The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="2">
<li><p>Basic Permissions.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.</p>
<p>You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.</p>
<p>Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="3">
<li><p>Protecting Users’ Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.</p>
<p>When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work’s
users, your or third parties’ legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="4">
<li><p>Conveying Verbatim Copies.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>You may convey verbatim copies of the Program’s source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.</p>
<p>You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="5">
<li><p>Conveying Modified Source Versions.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</p>
<p>a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
it, and giving a relevant date.</p>
<p>b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
released under this License and any conditions added under section
7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
“keep intact all notices”.</p>
<p>c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.</p>
<p>d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
work need not make them do so.</p>
<p>A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
“aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation’s users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="6">
<li><p>Conveying Non-Source Forms.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:</p>
<p>a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
customarily used for software interchange.</p>
<p>b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.</p>
<p>c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
with subsection 6b.</p>
<p>d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.</p>
<p>e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
charge under subsection 6d.</p>
<p>A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.</p>
<p>A “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received by a particular user, “normally used” refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.</p>
<p>“Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.</p>
<p>If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).</p>
<p>The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.</p>
<p>Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="7">
<li><p>Additional Terms.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.</p>
<p>When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:</p>
<p>a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or</p>
<p>b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
Notices displayed by works containing it; or</p>
<p>c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
reasonable ways as different from the original version; or</p>
<p>d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
authors of the material; or</p>
<p>e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or</p>
<p>f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
those licensors and authors.</p>
<p>All other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further
restrictions” within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.</p>
<p>If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.</p>
<p>Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="8">
<li><p>Termination.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).</p>
<p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.</p>
<p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.</p>
<p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="9">
<li><p>Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="10">
<li><p>Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.</p>
<p>An “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party’s predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.</p>
<p>You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="11">
<li><p>Patents.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor’s “contributor version”.</p>
<p>A contributor’s “essential patent claims” are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, “control” includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.</p>
<p>Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor’s essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.</p>
<p>In the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To “grant” such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.</p>
<p>If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  “Knowingly relying” means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient’s use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.</p>
<p>If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.</p>
<p>A patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.</p>
<p>Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="12">
<li><p>No Surrender of Others’ Freedom.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="13">
<li><p>Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="14">
<li><p>Revised Versions of this License.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.</p>
<p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.</p>
<p>If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy’s
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.</p>
<p>Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="15">
<li><p>Disclaimer of Warranty.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="16">
<li><p>Limitation of Liability.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="17">
<li><p>Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.</p>
