== CHANGELOG ==
22/02/17:
 - Fixed bug where removing a site in data_plot.py would cause an error if only using a list file. Data.site_names was pointing directly to Raw.site_names rather than getting its own copy, and therefore the site would already be removed when RawData.remove_site was called.
22/02/17:
 - Added input 'mode' in RawData.get_locs that takes 'utm', 'latlong', or 'centered' to specify which type of site locations you want.
20/02/17:
 - Fixed bug where adding a period in data_plot would insert the period correctly for all components except one (whichever one was first through the loop in Site.add_periods).
 - to_vtk functions in IO now supports a sea level correction to model and site elevations.
 - Added script 'to_vtk.py' which gives command line dialog for getting .vtk files for models and / or sites.
17/02/17:
 - When hovering plots in GUI, mouse info is given for log10 and normal scale periods AND frequency.
 - Middle mouse button clicks (when data selection is on) now gives data point period, frequency, and percent availability among sites.
 - Fixed bug where changing between datasets caused an error if the sites weren't the same. Seems to be fixed but keep an eye on it.
 - data plot GUI requires at least 1 data period be selected (won't let you remove all periods)
16/02/17:
 - Added a 'check_compromised_data' method to Data and RawData that checks for impedance data with suspect signs, i.e. negative ZXYR when it should be positive. This does not necessarily mean the data is bad, but just that it should be checked (particularly the phases)
 - Changed the default marker size in gplot to be smaller, so that small error bars could actually be seen.
 - Changed the way phase errors are calculated. Now errors are an average of the phases taken from all possible combinations of data + error. Not exact but good enough for these purposes.
15/02/17:
 - Added 'Write List' and 'Write Data' options in the top menu of data plot GUI.
 - Relevent methods added to data_structures and IO.
 - Added / fixed phase plotting methods in gplot.
 - compute_phase in pyMT.utilss now calculates errors. Keep an eye to make sure if its right. Errors are still not calculated for determinant rho or phase, need to do that later.
13/02/17:
 - pyMT.IO now issues WSFileError if datafile and listfile are mismatched (unequal number of sites). Also added relevant test case unit tests.
11/02/17:
 - Fixed bug in utils.geo2utm where a new origin was being computed for each Lat/Long pair rather than having a single origin for all sites. This also fixed the error in data_plot.py where sites read from raw data were not plotted properly on the map.
 - Fixed IO.model_to_vtk to read model origin from the model object if available.
10/02/17 - Added a few tools to utils, including a filtering operation that can be used, for example, to smooth rho or phase prior to bostick transform.
     - Added options for geometric / arithmetic average (gav/aav) calculations to the compute_rho/phase functions in utils.
     - Added compute_bost1D to utils, which calculates the 1-D Bostick-Niblett transform for a given site.
     - RawData objects now reject dummy period data when data is read. Data whose values are constant across all periods are removed. This is checked via the method check_dummy_periods, and if any sites are found with dummy data, the periods are removed with remove_periods
07/02/17 - Fixed a bug where Data.remove_site() would remove sites from the dictionary and site list, but not data.locations
     - Changed the precision of the data printed in IO.write_data to match that printed out using j2ws3d
     - Stopped tracking the various pystart files in DataGUI/
27/01/17 - Added TODO.txt, changed remote to Github repo rather than having working folder --> local repo --> local bare repo --> remote repo
25/01/17 - Renamed wsinv3dmt module to pyMT, and made relevant changes to the submodules
     - Fixed bug where dataset didn't actually fix unequal azimuths
     - Renamed main module from wsinv3dmt to pyMT, made changes to submodules to reflect this.
24/01/17 - Print periods in data_plot.py now prints fixed width columns with headers
22/01/17 - Refactored command line parsing out of main() from data_plot.py.
