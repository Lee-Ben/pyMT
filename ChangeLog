== CHANGELOG ==
06/24/17:
 - Committed changes to IO, adding functions for ModEM and MARE2DEM data files
 - Changed some things to allow handling of Rho and Phase data. More work on this to be done later.
 - Began changing how error floors are calculated and applied.
 - Added Site and Data class methods to add noise to data (for synthetics).
23/06/17:
 - Made some changes to accomodate update to pyqt5. Keep an eye out for any bugs this might introduce.
13/06/17:
 - Changed data / list writing from DataGUI such that:
        - If site order is changed in GUI, the data file is written to reflect the change.
        - If site order is changed, you are prompted to write out a list file as well as a data file.
        - Made the Popups clearer as to which is for data and which is for lists
        - GUI now properly appends the proper extention to the output file PRIOR to checking files existence (and hence will properly give overwrite warning)
28/04/17:
 - Added 'link axes' option (note this just sets the bounds the same for each plot)
??/??/??:
 - Added RMS table to data_plot GUI.
 - 
28/03/17:
 - Finished writing calculate_RMS for Dataset objects.
 - data_plot can now write plots to files. Saves figure at its current size, may need to be changed in the future.
08/03/17:
 - Added z-mesh generation to mesh_designer. Bulk changes to mesh (either in Z or XY) will result in the model being changed to a half-space if it wasn't already.
06/03/17:
 - Made mesh_designer callable as a script. Takes model and data file names as command line inputs.
 - Added 'sort_files' to utils, which goes through a given list of files and sorts them into a dictionary where the keys are file types (model, resp, data, lst)
02/03/17:
 - mesh_designer is more or less up and running. Changes to data_structures.Model to accomadate.
 - Fixed bug in compute_bost1D where comp was not being set if no argument was passed.
 - Changed bost1D script so that listfile is not needed.
 - Added a bit more to j2ws3d. Should be able to use it now, although still not tested.
 - Added most of the base functionality to mesh_designer. Can now save and revert progress, and write out model file.
 - Added GUI_common module that contains some of the common functions and classes used in the GUIs.
01/03/17:
 - Finished generate_lateral_mesh and generate_zmesh in utils.
 - IO.read_model now just assumes 1 dummy line at the top, and that the 2nd line contains NZ, NX, NZ
27/02/17:
 - Fixed bug in to_vtk.py script where Dataset was created even if no datafile or listfile were specified, which created an error.
 - read_model didn't flip the X (north-south) coordinates as they should. Changed that, and changed model_to_vtk accordingly.
24/02/17:
 - Changed the components list in data_plot to a table, with each type (e.g. impedance, tipper, phase, etc.) as headers.
 - Added bostick plotting to gplot and data_plot.
22/02/17:
 - Fixed bug where removing a site in data_plot.py would cause an error if only using a list file. Data.site_names was pointing directly to Raw.site_names rather than getting its own copy, and therefore the site would already be removed when RawData.remove_site was called.
22/02/17:
 - Added input 'mode' in RawData.get_locs that takes 'utm', 'latlong', or 'centered' to specify which type of site locations you want.
20/02/17:
 - Fixed bug where adding a period in data_plot would insert the period correctly for all components except one (whichever one was first through the loop in Site.add_periods).
 - to_vtk functions in IO now supports a sea level correction to model and site elevations.
 - Added script 'to_vtk.py' which gives command line dialog for getting .vtk files for models and / or sites.
17/02/17:
 - When hovering plots in GUI, mouse info is given for log10 and normal scale periods AND frequency.
 - Middle mouse button clicks (when data selection is on) now gives data point period, frequency, and percent availability among sites.
 - Fixed bug where changing between datasets caused an error if the sites weren't the same. Seems to be fixed but keep an eye on it.
 - data plot GUI requires at least 1 data period be selected (won't let you remove all periods)
16/02/17:
 - Added a 'check_compromised_data' method to Data and RawData that checks for impedance data with suspect signs, i.e. negative ZXYR when it should be positive. This does not necessarily mean the data is bad, but just that it should be checked (particularly the phases)
 - Changed the default marker size in gplot to be smaller, so that small error bars could actually be seen.
 - Changed the way phase errors are calculated. Now errors are an average of the phases taken from all possible combinations of data + error. Not exact but good enough for these purposes.
15/02/17:
 - Added 'Write List' and 'Write Data' options in the top menu of data plot GUI.
 - Relevent methods added to data_structures and IO.
 - Added / fixed phase plotting methods in gplot.
 - compute_phase in pyMT.utilss now calculates errors. Keep an eye to make sure if its right. Errors are still not calculated for determinant rho or phase, need to do that later.
13/02/17:
 - pyMT.IO now issues WSFileError if datafile and listfile are mismatched (unequal number of sites). Also added relevant test case unit tests.
11/02/17:
 - Fixed bug in utils.geo2utm where a new origin was being computed for each Lat/Long pair rather than having a single origin for all sites. This also fixed the error in data_plot.py where sites read from raw data were not plotted properly on the map.
 - Fixed IO.model_to_vtk to read model origin from the model object if available.
10/02/17 - Added a few tools to utils, including a filtering operation that can be used, for example, to smooth rho or phase prior to bostick transform.
     - Added options for geometric / arithmetic average (gav/aav) calculations to the compute_rho/phase functions in utils.
     - Added compute_bost1D to utils, which calculates the 1-D Bostick-Niblett transform for a given site.
     - RawData objects now reject dummy period data when data is read. Data whose values are constant across all periods are removed. This is checked via the method check_dummy_periods, and if any sites are found with dummy data, the periods are removed with remove_periods
07/02/17 - Fixed a bug where Data.remove_site() would remove sites from the dictionary and site list, but not data.locations
     - Changed the precision of the data printed in IO.write_data to match that printed out using j2ws3d
     - Stopped tracking the various pystart files in DataGUI/
27/01/17 - Added TODO.txt, changed remote to Github repo rather than having working folder --> local repo --> local bare repo --> remote repo
25/01/17 - Renamed wsinv3dmt module to pyMT, and made relevant changes to the submodules
     - Fixed bug where dataset didn't actually fix unequal azimuths
     - Renamed main module from wsinv3dmt to pyMT, made changes to submodules to reflect this.
24/01/17 - Print periods in data_plot.py now prints fixed width columns with headers
22/01/17 - Refactored command line parsing out of main() from data_plot.py.
